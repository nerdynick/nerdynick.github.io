      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I ran into an issue while trying to create a new instance of HomeAssistant on a K3s install of Kubernetes.&#xA;Getting HomeAssistant up and running and connected to an MQTT server within the same cluster worked as expected.&#xA;However, the issue came up when I attempted to get it to connect to NabuCasa or make connections out to any TLS/SSL (HTTPS) addresses.&#xA;Viewing the HomeAssistant logs from the &lt;code&gt;Settings-&amp;gt;System-&amp;gt;Logs&lt;/code&gt; area, I noticed I was getting a very vague error of &lt;code&gt;tlsv1 unrecognized name&lt;/code&gt;.&#xA;Searching around the internet for the issue affecting HomeAssistant just kept turning up people having issues with DNS but no actual &amp;ldquo;What the DNS issue was&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;That was until I came across a &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66630929/kubenetes-pod-curl-works-only-if-domain-name-ends-with&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Kubernetes StackOverflow Question&lt;/a&gt; where the person was getting the same issue but with a completely different application.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;p class=&#34;alert-heading&#34;&gt;&#xA;      ℹ️&#xA;      &#xA;        Note&#xA;      &#xA;    &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;    &lt;p&gt;Originall this article only made mention of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ori-edge/k8s_gateway&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ori-edge/k8s_gateway&lt;/a&gt; project.&#xA;This project is now no longer maintained and development as switched over to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/k8s-gateway/k8s_gateway&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;k8s-gateway/k8s_gateway&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my efforts to run a self-hosted Kubernetes cluster(s) in my lab.&#xA;I needed a way to easily expose services outside of the cluster for easy use by me and the family/friends.&#xA;In my research, I stumbled upon the Kubernetes Sig &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ExternalDNS&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;Its goal is to leverage K8 Service Annotates to provide the desired external DNS entry values and the respective configs to go along with it.&#xA;However, in my attempt to make this work in a self-hosted environment with minimal deployment in a small footprint on small hardware (RPis mostly), I came across many challenges.&#xA;Many of the integrations that ExternalDNS supports are focused on Cloud Provider DNS services rather than self-hosted one.&#xA;Of the self-hosted DNS options, many have large footprints in their deployments.&#xA;Such as the need for Databases or other services.&#xA;This left me looking at my favorite DNS service, CoreDNS.&#xA;However, in an attempt to get the CoreDNS ExternalDNS integration to work.&#xA;I found out that it requires an &lt;a href=&#34;https://etcd.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;etcd&lt;/a&gt; service to be available.&#xA;As well as that the plugins the integration relies on at both the ExternalDNS and CoreDNS sides appear to not be maintained much anymore.&#xA;Yet alone, the etcd approach is seen as a deprecated one in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

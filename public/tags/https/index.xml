      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I ran into an issue while trying to create a new instance of HomeAssistant on a K3s install of Kubernetes.&#xA;Getting HomeAssistant up and running and connected to an MQTT server within the same cluster worked as expected.&#xA;However, the issue came up when I attempted to get it to connect to NabuCasa or make connections out to any TLS/SSL (HTTPS) addresses.&#xA;Viewing the HomeAssistant logs from the &lt;code&gt;Settings-&amp;gt;System-&amp;gt;Logs&lt;/code&gt; area, I noticed I was getting a very vague error of &lt;code&gt;tlsv1 unrecognized name&lt;/code&gt;.&#xA;Searching around the internet for the issue affecting HomeAssistant just kept turning up people having issues with DNS but no actual &amp;ldquo;What the DNS issue was&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;That was until I came across a &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66630929/kubenetes-pod-curl-works-only-if-domain-name-ends-with&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Kubernetes StackOverflow Question&lt;/a&gt; where the person was getting the same issue but with a completely different application.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
